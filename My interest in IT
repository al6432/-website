  <h2> My interest in IT </h2>
   
  <p> What’s my interest in IT I guess I don’t have a particular field that I’m interested in, I am interested is about the possibilities that with the influence of technology could bring to develop and progress in order to in better our lives in how we interact with each other  and with other device. Although I guess AI does interest me in how they are able to learn and  it seems that through the progression of AI we can learn more about ourself.

  <p> My Interest In IT began when was in primary school with a friend that would tell me about all the programs and scrips that he made and how they influence other device. He would go through how verias devices work, he would even tell me about how computer language worked and would go into bionary and other ideas that he would have  which this had fascinated me. My IT experience is when I was in the IT room setting up the new school computers for work experience.

  <p> I chose RMIT cause I feel as that it’s flexible in how the courses will carry out  being that I am doing this course online it seems as it can be fixed to around your schedule and if you miss a live session their will be a recording of that session and that  RMIT specialize in AI which I want expand my understanding he would even tell me about how computer language worked and would go into bionary and other ideas that he would have  which this had fascinated me. My IT experience is when I was in the IT room setting up the new school computers for work experience.
