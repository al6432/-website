  <h2> My Project idea </h2>
    <br> 
    <h3> The Overview of my project idea </h3> 
  <p> My project idea is an app for mobile devices, where the user could bind keys from a game they are playing to a mobile device that is to produce buttons and movement controls that connects to the buttons that are used in the game to emulate the functions of a  game controller or any other controller and to allow the amount of buttons that the user could make to be unlimited and so these could be moved and placed to where the user wants on the device, making this able to be  customised to the users needs and allows it to be unique. </p> 
    <br>
    <h3> Motivation of my project idea</h3> 
    <p> When I was 5 I had a stroke as episode that resulted in me having a disease called dystonia which is a neurological disorder that make it difficult to move my muscles and this had effected the right side of my body or in other words my right arm and right leg. This putting me in a wheelchair and had made me feel lonely and distant cause I couldn’t really interact with other kids and being that I can use one hand which makes the act of playing games difficult to use the controller, well it’s not that I’m bad at using game controllers it’s that to be able to adapt to this took a bit. I bet the way I use a controller, if I were playing a game on the street, a person would give me five dollars. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Description of my project idea </h3>
    <p> The functions that my project idea will include is that the app will allow mobile devices to connect to different gaming engines so that the mobile device can emulate as a game Controller where the user can set the controls that would be used in the game to their mobile device so that they can interact with the game. This will be enabled by a menu that when pressed it’ll display an option of buttons and movement controls to choose from, when the option is chosen another screen will come up that asks the user what controls this can be assigned to. When the user wants to connect the device to the gaming engines that game using there will be an option in the menu that will allow the user to choose what gaming engine they need so that the assigned controls that the game has can be accessed from the device which this will allow it to be used with different devices as pc . 
    </p>
    <p> This product will allow the  user to make any number of  controls so if theirs the need that requires more  as a pc game that has more keys to be able to play with a game. there will be an order of command that will enable the user to choose and set out to a button a set of controls that can be assigned to active those chosen control in an order of activation which is that if the user is in a situation where they are finding it difficult to do a move or activate something they can fix the order of the controls that are activated so that they can a custom it to their needs.
    </p>
    <p> The option to do this will be located in the menu where the user would assign the controls to a button and this will is done by the section that the controls are chosen in order, although if there happens to be an incident where the user assigns more then they needed, there will be a button with a cross at the top left corner of the control option that had been selected that will remove the chosen control and this will be shown by the cross being removed. There will be a button on the top of the screen of the device that will allow the user to move the buttons and movement controls position to where ever on the device that they want to set it to which will be activated when pressed allowing the user to move and place the controls to they want it and when they want to fix it to where they need them to be placed, the user can press the button for the controls  to not move, this is so that the user can set out the place of the controls and will meet their needs and will make it unique to them and how they want to play
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h3> Tools and Technology that are needed for my project idea </h3>
    <p> The software component of my project will be done by use Kivy and Python to make my app cause with the Kivy library will be able to use the app on other platform  as Windows, Mac, IOS, android devices that had mentioned by freeCodeCamp.org (may 12, 2021) . The hardware that is needed would be a computer to write the software of the app on and a mobile device as my phone, my I pad, my tablet to test the software of my app so if there’s any issues to fix. 
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h3> Skills required of my project idea </h3>
    <p> I would want to enable access to the devices wirelessly so that the user can accessibly use the device no constraint which I would need to learn how to access and enable blue tooth with python. How to produce new buttons to assign them with the controls that’s in the game, how to access the games controls so that the buttons and the movement controls that will be on the device to activate the controls in the game. how to make the button placement so that the user can arrange it to how they want it and to set it in place so that the buttons don’t when in use. The feasibility of the requirements of my project idea is that it can be fulfilled  cause what’s needed Is accessible through the courses on freeCodeCamp.org and other tutorials such as (Clever Techie, 2020) and (Easy Tutorials, 2021)  that’s used to make this website  , although what I’m unsure about is the how the access to the games controls will go.    
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3> The outcome of my project idea </h3>
    <p> The outcome of my project idea is that the users that are not able to hold a game controller or use a keyboard and mouse or any other way that limits their interactions with games and to enable them to be socially involved in friend groups and to allow them to interact with other people cause this allows them to arrange and customise the controls to suit their own needs and makes where the user’s controls are set to, are unique to them.
