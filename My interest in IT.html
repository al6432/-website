  <h2> My interest in IT </h2>
   <br> 
    <h3> What is your interest in IT?</h3>
  <p> What’s my interest in IT I guess I don’t have a particular field that I’m interested in, I am interested is about the possibilities that with the influence of technology could bring to develop and progress in order to in better our lives in how we interact with each other  and with other device. Although I guess AI does interest me in how they are able to learn and  it seems that through the progression of AI we can learn more about ourself.  
  </p>

    <h3> When did your interest in IT start? </h3> 
  <p> My Interest In IT began when was in primary school with a friend that would tell me about all the programs and scrips that he made and how they influence other device. He would go through how various devices work, he would even tell me about how computer language worked and would go into binary and other ideas that he would have  which this had fascinated me. My IT experience is when I was in the IT room setting up the new school computers for work experience.

    <h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
  <p> I chose RMIT cause I feel as that it’s flexible in how the courses will carry out  being that I am doing this course online it seems as it can be fixed to around your schedule and if you miss a live session there will be a recording of that session and that  RMIT specialize in AI which I want to expand my understanding 
  </p> 
    <br> 
    <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
    <p> What I expect to learn is to better my understanding in IT in how this is used to make and develop various devices and to extend the view of what’s in the field of IT and to find out if there are other ways that IT can be applied to. Which from this course will lead onto  either computer science or Information technology, so that I can progress my learning more in depth in IT.
