   <h2> My Personal Profile </h2>
   <br>
    <h3> My results from tests </h3>  
  <p> My stats, i guess that form the results of the type ENFJ-T from the Myer Brigg 16 personality test ( mar 7, 2022) are 57% extroverted and 43% introverted, 74% intuitive and 26% observant, 29% thinking and 71% feeling, 61% judging and 39% prospecting, 44% assertive and 56% turbulent. 
    </p>
    <p> The results for the learning style test (mar 23,2022) is that I am a visual learner meaning that I learn better when I see what’s happening, so seeing pictures and reading.   
    </p> 
    <p> The results for the other test that I chose which is the five big personality test (mar 23. 2022) are extraversion is medium , agreeableness is medium, conscientious is low, neuroticism is low, openness to experiences is medium.            
    </p> 
    <br> 
    <h3> What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
    <p> What the results of these tests mean for me is that they give people an outside view of  how they are when  other  people see them and the result that I got from these tests are apparently accurate, although aside from the 7% difference to make me extroverted as seen in the Myers Briggs test is a shock, when looking at the results for the other test that i did, i couldn’t help but agree, although I guess it does depend on whether the source is reliable. 
    </p>
   
    <br>
    <h3> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
    <p> The results of these tests would influence my behaviour in a team because it reassures a person what they have and exposes them what qualities they have, therefore reaffirming what the person has and how they would act in a team working environment.    
 </p> 
    <br>
    <h3> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
<p> I haven’t really thought about it, well it isn’t as I wouldn’t or not to take this into account, it’s that this hasn’t come to mind, I would usually be left and be in a team with someone that isn’t in a team or with my friends if they are there, so i guess how I should take this into account is that I should look for a good team dynamic that has a good working environment and people that are passionate about their work or anyone that’s friendly, people that can cover for areas where others might lack,  I’m fine if anyone wants to be the team leader, if not  I will accommodate where need be.
